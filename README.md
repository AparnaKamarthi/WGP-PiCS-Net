# WGP-PiCS-Net
The WGP-PiCCS-Net is a physics-informed deep learning model for predicting compressive strength of concrete with waste glass powder. It uses engineered features (e.g., inverse W/C, WGP/Binder, packing index) and a custom loss to ensure realistic, accurate, and sustainable mix design optimization.
